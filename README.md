Tic Tac Toe - manikanta_PlayableAdTest

Overview
This project is an HTML5 playable ad for Tic Tac Toe, designed for interactive engagement before redirecting users to the Google Play Store. The ad consists of a promotional website, a mini Tic Tac Toe game, and an automatic redirection to the app store.

Features
1. Website Preview (First 10 seconds): Displays game information, ratings, and install buttons.
2. Playable Game (10s - 25s): Loads a Tic Tac Toe game inside an iframe.
3. Auto-Redirect (After 25s): Automatically redirects users to the Google Play Store.

key code:
setTimeout(() => {
    document.getElementById("websiteContent").style.display = "none";
    document.getElementById("gamePage").style.display = "block";

    setTimeout(() => {
        window.location.href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arcsys.tictactoe&hl=en_IN";
    }, 15000);
}, 10000);


How It Works
The index.html page loads first and remains visible for 10 seconds.

After 10 seconds, the Tic Tac Toe game (game.html) is displayed inside an iframe.

After an additional 15 seconds (total 25 seconds), the page automatically redirects to the Google Play Store link.

Installation & Usage

Download the project files.

Open index.html in a browser.

2. Deployment
